                    <p class="piller-p">The Penultimate Mission for the game Halo Reach is The Pillar Of Autumn.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">The level takes place on August 30, 2552, near the ship-breaking yards at Aszod.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">The level opens with the remainder of Noble Team on a Pelican, to deliver Cortana to the Pillar of Autumn.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">Emile-A239 and SPARTAN-B312 execute a low-altitude jump from the Pelican outside of the dockyard and are forced to fight their way to the facility.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">Upon reaching the other side, however, they are confronted by a Scarab.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">Carter rams it with the Pelican, knocking it off a cliff and sacrificing himself in the process.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">Emile mans the facility's mass driver to provide covering fire against incoming Covenant Phantoms.</p>
                    <p class="piller-p">Keyes returns to the landing platform and offers Noble Six transportation to safety. The SPARTAN-III refuses and offers to defend the Captain as he heads towards his ship.</p>

                        <li>grab z</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="text-right">You know where you need to go. Getting there is going to be an issue though. Advance until you can see the Pillar of Autumn in the distance.</p>
                    <p class="text-right">Carter has given you a chance, take it. Advance again, keeping your DMR out. Your going to run into some Drones.</p>
                    <p class="text-right">Just before you exit the caves on the ground there will be a Spartan Laser, make note of it because you are going to come back for it.</p>
                    <p class="text-right">Once inside the facility you are going to run into an anteroom next to a large machine room..</p>
                    <p class="text-right">Head out onto the landing pad area. Now there are several strategies for dealing with this area. You are going to have to defend this area against several (3-4) waves of enemy troops.</p>
                    <p class="text-right">OK. You're down to your last hurrah. The Mass Driver Cannon is just up the stairs. Now you can hop in the driver's seat and plug away at Phantoms and Banshees until the CCS-class Battlecruiser is in range and then fire..</p>

            <div id="sec-2">Halo Reach Narritive</div>
            <div id="under-sec-2" class="row">
                <div id="left-text" class="column">
                    <p id="left-p">Noble Six meets the rest of Noble Team, shortly before they are dispatched to investigate why a communications relay has gone offline. They discover Covenant forces have invaded Reach. The team is relocated to defend Sword Base, an Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) installation, from a Covenant assault. After repelling the attack, Noble Team meets Catherine Halsey, a scientist and the mastermind behind the Spartan program and their MJOLNIR powered armor. Halsey enquires about Noble's engagement at the relay, suspecting that the Covenant were attempting to retrieve highly classified ONI data from the site.</p>
                    <p id="right-p">Jun and Six discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The UNSC launches an assault the next morning to repel the invasion. Noble Team assists the strike force, targeting key artillery stations and command posts. A cloaked Covenant supercarrier reveals itself; lacking a conventional weapon to destroy the carrier, Jorge and Six smuggle a slipspace engine onto a Covenant corvette en route to refuel at the carrier. With the timer damaged, Jorge drops Six out of the hangar of the corvette, remaining behind to detonate the engine manually and destroy the carrier. Another Covenant fleet arrives soon afterwards.

                        Back on the surface, Six assists with city defense and civilian evacuation and reunites with Noble Team, but Kat is killed by a Covenant sniper. Recalled to Sword Base for a demolition mission, Noble Team is redirected underground by Halsey to an ancient alien artifact, which she believes is vital to winning the war against the Covenant. Noble Team is entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence Cortana and her data on the artifact to the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn, docked at a shipyard. Jun leaves the team to escort Halsey to safety.
                        
                        En route to the Pillar of Autumn, Carter is wounded and sacrifices himself to allow Six and Emile to reach the shipyard. Emile uses a mass driver emplacement to defend the Autumn against enemies while Six gives Cortana to Autumn's captain, Jacob Keyes. When Emile is killed, Six remains behind to operate the gun and ensure Autumn's escape. Cortana, using the data from the alien artifact, leads the Autumn to a Halo ringworld, leading to the events of Halo: Combat Evolved. In a post-credits scene, Six fights a last stand against overwhelming Covenant forces. In 2589, Six's helmet remains on the grassy plains of a now-restored Reach. A narration by Halsey eulogizes Noble Team, who enabled humanity's victory over the Covenant.</p>
